Stream API is used to process Collection of Objects

Consumer Functional Interface takes object as i/p & performs some operation without returning any result.
    Syntax - void accept(T t);

Predicate Functional Interface is a true/false returning function.
    Syntax - boolean Test(T t);

Supplier Functional Interface takes no i/p but expects an o/p.
    Syntax - T get();

Stream is a sequence of objects supporting various methods which can be pipelined to produce desired results.
It's not a Data Structure instead it takes i/p from the Collections, Arrays or I/O Channels.
It don't change original data structure, they only provide the results as per the pipelined methods.
    Functional Programming (Lambda)
    Code Reducer
    Bulk Operations : Massive Collection Objects

Java Parallel Streams (traditional one is Sequential)
    - Utilizing multiple cores of processor
    - Order of execution isn't under our control.
