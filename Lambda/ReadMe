Lambda Expression is the expression through which we can represent Anonymous Function.

Anonymous Function is the one that don't have any name/modifier.
    Even if you take the braces out, it will still work.
    If it has a parameter, Lambda don't need to have the type e.g. (i) will work.
    Lambda doesn't even need to have the "return".

Functional Interface contains only 1 Abstract Method but can have multiple default & static methods.
e.g. Runnable -> run()
     Callable -> call()
     Comparable -> compareTo()
     Comparator -> compare()
